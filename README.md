You can also try these dotfiles without polluting your development environment.

vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```

This repo also includes the Base16 Ocean Dark color theme both for [Terminal.app](https://github.com/korzhyk/base16-terminal-app/blob/master/base16-ocean.dark.terminal) and [iTerm2](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2/blob/master/base16-ocean.dark.itermcolors), and the [Monoid font](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/).

## Make your own customizations

Put your customizations either in `~/.dotfiles-local/symlinks/` or at the root appended with `.local`. Customizable symlinks include:

- `gitconfig.local`
- `tmux.conf.local`
- `vimrc.local`
- `vimrc.bundles.local`
- `zshenv.local`
- `zshrc.local`
- `zshrc.plugins.local`

For example, your `gitconfig.local` might look like the following:

```ini
[user]
  name = Ayan Yenbekbays
  email = ayan.yenb@gmail.com
  github = yenbekbay
  signingkey = ayan.yenb@gmail.com
[commit]
  gpgsign = true
[gpg]
  program = /usr/local/bin/gpg2
```

If you added your local dotfiles in `~/.dotfiles-local/symlinks`, run `syncdotfiles` to apply your changes.
